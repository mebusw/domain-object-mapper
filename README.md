Domain Object Mapper
====================

## What does it do?
Use DSL style to map object to defined domain object.

## Why use it?
E.g. in Django framework, the db.models classes is for both domain knowledge and database accessing (like DAO or Repository).
According to [Domain Driven Design](), it's better to seperate domain objects from DB models.
